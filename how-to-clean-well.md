1\) Bleaching powder available in the markets tend to contain 30-40% of chlorine. The following shall be explained while taking into account a minimum of 33% chlorine content in the bleaching powder used  
2\) We first need to take into account the amount of water the well contains, to do this first take the diameter of the well in meters as \(D\), next take the deapth of the well in meters by immersing the bucket till the well's deepest point \(H\), Amount of water =   3.14 x D x D x H x 250 liter   
3\) Regular Chlorination requires 2.5g of bleaching powder per 1000 liters, But in order to sanitize the water after being contaminated by the flood water the process of Super Chlorination is required, this process involves adding 5g of bleaching powder per 1000 liters  
4\) According to the amount of water present in the well, take the required amount of bleaching powder into a plastic bucket, add a small amount of water and mix till a thick paste is formed. Fill the bucket 3/4 with water and mix till combined, then leave it for 10 minutes.  
5\)  After 10 mins, the residue will settle at the bottom of the bucket and the water will be throughly Chlorinated.Pour the Chlorinated water into the bucket used to pull water and slowly immerse the bucket till the bottom of the well, use an up and down motion to throughly mix the Chlorine into the well water  
6\) After allowing the water to settle for at least an hour, you can start to use the water
