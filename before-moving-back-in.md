# Ensure before moving back in

Once the flood waters have receded, you must not live in your house until:

* Every flood-contaminated room has been thoroughly cleaned, disinfected and surface-dried.
* All contaminated dishes and utensils have been thoroughly washed and disinfected - either by using boiling water or by using a sterilizing solution of one part chlorine bleach to four parts water. Rinse dishes and utensils thoroughly.
* Adequate toilet facilities are available.
